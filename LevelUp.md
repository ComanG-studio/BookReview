# LevelUp goes brrr

## Entry To the "Level up"

"*You should be thinking about gameplay all the time and how things affect the player, even when designing passive elements like cutscenes, monetization models, and pause screens.*"
    First of all it`s not overthinking. It is caring about quality and "fun" of the end product.


THE FIRST **VERY IMPORTANT THING** OF THE BOOK:
            "**GAME DESIGNERS HAVE MORE FUN**"
THE SECOND **VERY IMPORTANT THING** OF THE BOOK:
            "**NO ONE ON YOUR TEAM WANTS TO *READ* YOUR DESIGN DOCUMENT**"
(Yeah, yeah that "Show and tell" rule in work...It`s not bad but it is kinda obvious)

U-fu-fu~~ Sound aristocratic I like this book:
"Don’t get me wrong, theory is great when you are at a game developers conference or one of those wine and cheese affairs we game designers always find ourselves at."
Yeah by the way Book is about ti tell that it is about practical expirience.

Author tells how he was beginer and writes this: 
"*Or a programmer who knows he can design a better enemy encounter than the knucklehead currently doing it on your game.*"
And Me who reads this be like: "*Yes, Valentyn?*"

As the student (not in game design but still) it kinda inspiring quote:
"*This book is also great **for students of video game design**. Back when I started making games, I didn’t take any classes on video game design—because they didn’t exist! I just made stuff up as I went along! And I made a lot of mistakes. This is why I wrote this book: so you can learn from all **my** mistakes before they become **your** mistakes too.*"

Hee-hee I know that industry needs skills and not dreamers, but this book spills redelious truths:

"*Finally, this book is for **anyone who loves video games**. I love video games. I love to play them. I love to make them and I love to read about making them. If you want to make video games, then you must love them too. Ironically, I know several people who work in video games that freely admit they do not like to play video games. That does not make any sense to me. Why would you work in video games if you do not love video games? They are fools. They should just step aside and let someone who loves video games make video games. Someone like you.*"

Guys we`ll eat chilli today.You have no choice:
"*At the very least, make sure to try the new chili recipe.*"

## Geting N00bed

Don`t call me noob I was just intrested:
"1*The term “n00b” is short for “newbie,” or someone who is new to a game or other venture. While the term predates the Internet, it became popular with MMORPG communities. Not a particularly flattering term, as it implies inexperience and/or ignorance. For example, only a real n00b would read a footnote defining what a n00b is!*"

Oh master I am the on who reads everything in the book(exept forewords `cause fuck `em, am I right?)
"*It’s pretty basic stuff and if you already know it all and are not a n00b, feel free to skip it. However, you are going to be missing out on a lot of great stuff.*"

Ground rules... Really very ground.
"*Q: What is a game?*
 *A: A game is an activity that*
    -*Requires at least one player*
    -*Has rules*
    -*Has a win and/or lose condition*"

Second ground rule.
"*A game needs a clear objective so the player knows what the goal is. You should be able to sum up a game’s objectives quickly and clearly /.../ The lesson is, you need to keep your game objectives simple.*"

### History

 So  yeah...

### Game Genres

"*The term **genre** is used to describe a category of something—often the categories used to describe books, movies or music. Music can be rock and roll, gospel, or country. Movies can be action, romance, or comedies. Books can be dramas, biographies, or horror; you get the idea.*"

Yeah shooter is a genre and top down it`s more about view and not a genre. Awkward situation.

By the way we`re talking her only about *game genre* and not about *story genre*

Oh sh---...There`s a lot coming on in Level5
"*...you’ll find a big list in **Bonus Level 5** describing all sorts of sub-genres and hybrids genres with lots of examples.*"
