## Core Mechanic

  ### Player mechanics
        - You send your flying machine into flight with a slingshot by "choosing" vector of the flight and power of the start
        - If machine is falling once in *n* seconds you can you can catapult it back into the air with trampoline 2 or 3 times
        - You can also do a backflip on your machine... That the only control you have in the game.

  ### World mechanics
    - It spawns:
        - Birds, who slow down the machine makes machin fall
        - Cans, that speeds up the machine (whether it`s going up or down)
        - Coins (obviously)
        - Coin magnet (obviously)
        - Wind streams, that speeds up and lift machine into the skies or do exactly oposite if it`s blowing against you (it can be seen at the start on flag  near the slingshot )
        -Clouds, that won`t be a thing if you go through them but if you land on top of the one you`ll go up and it boost you up when you go through another on as you go up
        - Red bulls on the water, they will kick you back into the skies
        - Parts of other machines, it is random *collectibles*
    -World is actually not endless and you can reach the end to see win screen, but the world is absurdly long.

   ### Upgrades
        - Flag to show where wind is blowing
        - Coin magnet upgrade
        - Other machines(can be bought via *collectibles*) 
        - Boat upgrades, to use trampoline more often
        - Slingshot upgrades, slingshot shoots you into the sky even better
